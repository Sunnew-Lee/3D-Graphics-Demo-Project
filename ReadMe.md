* We have 3 projects. one is Geometry+Tesselation demo, ShadowMapping demo, and the rest.
* To run on visual studio, open opengl-dev.sln and change start projects to run.
* In the EXE folder, we have pre-built binaries to run the exe.
* The tutorial-1.exe has most of the demos in it. You can toggle the wire frame mode with the IMGUI check box.
